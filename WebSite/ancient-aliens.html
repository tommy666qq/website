            <h2 class="section-title">The Ancient Astronaut Hypothesis</h2>
            <div class="content-block">
                <p>The Ancient Astronaut Theory, also known as the Ancient Alien Hypothesis, proposes that extraterrestrial beings visited Earth in ancient times and made contact with early human civilizations. This theory suggests that these visitors influenced human development, technology, religion, and culture, leaving behind evidence that can still be found in archaeological sites, ancient texts, and religious traditions worldwide.</p>
                
                <h3>Core Principles</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Technological Intervention:</strong> Ancient aliens provided advanced technology and knowledge to primitive humans</li>
                    <li><strong>Genetic Manipulation:</strong> Extraterrestrials may have influenced human evolution through genetic engineering</li>
                    <li><strong>Religious Influence:</strong> Many ancient gods and religious figures were actually alien visitors</li>
                    <li><strong>Monumental Construction:</strong> Ancient aliens helped humans build massive structures beyond their technological capabilities</li>
                    <li><strong>Cultural Exchange:</strong> Alien visitors shared knowledge of astronomy, mathematics, and other sciences</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Mainstream Archaeology</h3>
                <p>Most archaeologists and historians reject the ancient astronaut theory, arguing that ancient civilizations were capable of remarkable achievements through human ingenuity, trial and error, and gradual technological development.</p>
                
                <h3>Alternative Interpretations</h3>
                <p>Proponents of the theory argue that many archaeological mysteries cannot be explained by conventional theories and that ancient texts and artwork provide evidence of extraterrestrial contact.</p>
                
                <h3>Scientific Method</h3>
                <p>The debate centers on the interpretation of evidence and the application of Occam's Razor - whether the simplest explanation (human achievement) or the more complex explanation (alien intervention) is more likely.</p>
