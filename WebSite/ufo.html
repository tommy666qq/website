            <h2>Historical Sightings</h2>
            <h3>Classic Cases</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Roswell, New Mexico (1947):</strong> The most famous UFO incident in history began on July 8, 1947, when the Roswell Army Air Field issued a press release stating they had recovered a "flying disc" from a ranch near Roswell. The incident was later explained as a weather balloon, but declassified documents from Project Mogul suggest it was part of a classified military program to detect Soviet nuclear tests.<br>
                <em>Physical Evidence:</em> Debris described as lightweight metal with unusual properties<br>
                <em>Witness Testimony:</em> Over 300 witnesses interviewed over decades<br>
                <em>Government Response:</em> Initial confirmation followed by official denial<br>
                <em>Long-term Impact:</em> Established modern UFO culture and conspiracy theories</li>
                <li><strong>Aurora, Texas (1897):</strong> One of the earliest recorded UFO crashes in American history occurred on April 17, 1897, when an alleged airship collided with a windmill on Judge J.S. Proctor's property. Local newspaper reported the pilot was "not of this world" and was buried in the local cemetery.<br>
                <em>Historical Context:</em> Occurred during the "Great Airship Wave" of 1896-1897<br>
                <em>Physical Evidence:</em> Metal fragments allegedly recovered and analyzed<br>
                <em>Burial Site:</em> Unmarked grave in Aurora Cemetery<br>
                <em>Modern Investigation:</em> Metal detector sweeps in 1970s found anomalous readings</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Military Encounters</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>USS Nimitz Encounter (2004):</strong> U.S. Navy fighter pilots from the USS Nimitz carrier strike group encountered unidentified objects exhibiting flight characteristics beyond known human technology off the coast of California.<br>
                <em>Radar Detection:</em> Objects tracked at 80,000 feet descending to 50 feet in seconds<br>
                <em>Visual Confirmation:</em> Multiple pilots witnessed "Tic Tac" shaped objects<br>
                <em>Video Evidence:</em> FLIR footage released by Pentagon in 2020<br>
                <em>Performance Characteristics:</em> Instantaneous acceleration, hovering without visible propulsion</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Official Investigations</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Project Blue Book (1952-1969):</strong> The U.S. Air Force's systematic study of UFOs investigated 12,618 UFO reports, concluding that most could be explained by natural phenomena, conventional aircraft, or hoaxes. However, 701 cases remained "unidentified."<br>
                <em>Key Findings:</em> 94% of cases explained, 6% remained unidentified; scientific approach; public relations to reduce public concern.</li>
                <li><strong>Pentagon UAP Task Force (2020-Present):</strong> The Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force, later renamed the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), represents the modern official approach to UFO investigation.<br>
                <em>Current Activities:</em> Systematic gathering of military UAP encounters, threat assessment, technology analysis, public reporting to Congress.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Evidence Analysis</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Photographic Evidence:</strong> Visual documentation of UFO phenomena has evolved from analog photography to digital imaging and video, presenting both opportunities and challenges for authentication.<br>
                <em>Authentication Methods:</em> Film analysis, digital forensics, optical analysis, motion analysis.</li>
                <li><strong>Radar Data:</strong> Radar systems provide objective measurement of object position, velocity, and acceleration, offering crucial corroborating evidence for visual sightings.<br>
                <em>Radar Characteristics:</em> Instantaneous acceleration, right-angle turns, rapid altitude changes, variable radar cross-section.</li>
                <li><strong>Physical Trace Evidence:</strong> Landing sites and close encounter locations sometimes yield physical evidence including soil changes, radiation signatures, and electromagnetic effects.<br>
                <em>Common Effects:</em> Soil dehydration, plant damage, magnetic anomalies, unusual isotopic ratios.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Disclosure & Transparency</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Government Disclosure Timeline:</strong> The gradual release of classified UFO information represents a significant shift from decades of official denial and secrecy.<br>
                <em>Key Events:</em> 2017 NYT reveals Pentagon UFO program; 2020 Pentagon releases UAP videos; 2021 UAP Report to Congress; 2022-2023 Congressional hearings; 2023 whistleblower testimony.</li>
                <li><strong>International Disclosure:</strong> Multiple countries have released their UFO files, creating a global transparency movement.<br>
                <em>Initiatives:</em> UK MOD UFO files, France GEIPAN, Chile CEFAA, Brazil Operation Saucer.</li>
